WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.
